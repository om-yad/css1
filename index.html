            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you an use a special URL to link directly to an element and
            it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>

        <p>THere is a wide range of seletor vailable. Two of the most ommanly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
